# meditations

This series of code sketches, created in p5.js, use color, movement and interactivity to create meditative experiences. 
A response to the pain and chaos of our complex world, these meditations are meant to soothe and bring joy to the viewer. 
Integrating themes such as nature as playmate, what happens in the blink of an eye, and the craziness of a faculty meeting. 
Mesmerizing patterns in motion, all meant to provide calm and humor in what has been an unsettled time on this earth.
